## 🌟 Introducing Derby

Derby is not just an app; it's your round-the-clock personal assistant that converses with you. A cutting-edge fusion of voice recognition, AI image recognition, and articulate speech synthesis, Derby elevates your desktop experience to levels unimagined.

- Tech Support - "I can't see any menu button on my screen, where is it?"
- Programming - "Given the error i'm seeing in the output, fix this code"
- Homework - "What is the answer to question 3?"
- Emailing your boss - "Respond to this rude email from my boss in a professional manner saying I can't come in today"

Built with the robustness of Rust and the lightweight interface of Tauri, Derby harnesses the incredible capabilities of ChatGPT to respond to your voice commands with intelligent, context-aware insights.
